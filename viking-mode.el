;;; Commentary:

;; Viking minor  mode enables you to  delete things at point  with one
;; key stroke at once. More and more will be deleted if you repeat the
;; key stroke.  As visual  feedback the  thing to  be deleted  will be
;; highlighted shortly.

;; The default key binding is C-d, but  you may also bind it to C-k or
;; whatever you wish.

;; If you press C-d the first time,  the word at point will be deleted
;; (but if there's no word at  point but whitespaces or an empty line,
;; they will be deleted instead, which is the same as M-SPC).

;; If you press  C-d again, the remainder of the  line from point will
;; be deleted.  If pressed again,  the whole line, then  the paragraph
;; and finally the whole buffer will be deleted.

;; Like:
;; [keep pressing ctrl] C-d                  - del word | spc
;;                      C-d C-d              - del line remainder
;;                      C-d C-d C-d          - del line
;;                      C-d C-d C-d C-d      - del paragraph
;;                      C-d C-d C-d C-d C-d  - del buffer

;; However, this only works when pressing the  key in a row. If you do
;; something  else in  between, it  starts from  scratch (i.e.  delete
;; word).

;; By default viking-mode is greedy: after applying a kill function it
;; looks  if  point  ends  up  alone   on  an  empty  line  or  inside
;; whitespaces.  In  such a case, those  will be deleted as  well. The
;; greedy behavior may be turned off however.

;; Another  variant is  to use  viking  mode together  with the  great
;; expand-region mode (available on  melpa). If installed and enabled,
;; a  region is  first marked  using expand-region  and then  deleted.
;; This makes the deletion cascade language aware.

;;; Install:

;; To use, save viking-mode.el to a directory in your load-path.

;; Add something like this to your config:

;;    (require 'viking-mode)
;;    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'viking-mode)

;; or load it manually, when needed:

;;    M-x viking-mode

;; However, it's also possible to enable viking-mode globally:

;;    (viking-global-mode)

;;; Customize:

;; By  default viking-mode  doesn't really  delete things,  everything
;; remains available  for yanking in  the kill ring. However,  you may
;; turn it into berserk mode by setting 'viking-really-delete to t:

;;    (setq viking-really-delete t)

;; To  turn   off  greedy  deleting  of   whitespace  remainders,  set
;; 'viking-greedy-kill to nil:

;;     (setq viking-greedy-kill nil)

;; To enable quick deletion of regions using the normal key binding:

;;     (setq viking-enable-region-kill t)

;; You can change the default key binding by:

;;    (define-key viking-mode-map (kbd "C-k") 'viking-kill-thing-at-point)

;; In case  you don't like  the default  key binding cascade,  you may
;; also use separate bindings for each kill function, e.g.:

;;    (define-key viking-mode-map (kbd "C-d") nil)   ;; turn C-d into a prefix-key
;;    (define-key viking-mode-map (kbd "C-d w") 'viking-kill-word)
;;    (define-key viking-mode-map (kbd "C-d r") 'viking-kill-line-from-point)
;;    (define-key viking-mode-map (kbd "C-d l") 'viking-kill-line)
;;    (define-key viking-mode-map (kbd "C-d p") 'viking-kill-paragraph)
;;    (define-key viking-mode-map (kbd "C-d a") 'viking-kill-buffer)

;; To use viking-mode with expand-region:

;;    (setq viking-use-expand-region-when-loaded t)
;;    (require 'expand-region)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-=") 'er/expand-region)

;; Also, the font face of the short highlight can be modified:

;;    M-x customize-face  (select viking-blink)

;; The kill functions to be called in a row can be customized as well. The
;; default is this list:

;;     (setq vikink-kill-funcs (list 'viking-kill-word 'viking-kill-line-from-point
;;                                   'viking-kill-line 'viking-kill-paragraph
;;                                   'viking-kill-buffer))

;; Normally there should be no need  to modify it. However, this gives
;; you much more flexibility.

;; Or, modify all available viking-mode variables interactively with:

;;    M-x customize-group  (select viking-mode)

;;; Tips:

;; Besides, the primary function of viking-mode is viking-last-key-repeats,
;; which returns the number of times the last key have been pressed.
;; This can be used for other things as well, for example:

;;    (defun goto-begin()
;;      (interactive)
;;      (let* ((key-times (viking-last-key-repeats)))
;;        (cond
;;         ((eq key-times 3)
;;          (if mark-active
;;              (goto-char (point-min))
;;            (beginning-of-buffer))) 
;;         ((eq key-times 2)
;;          (if mark-active () (push-mark))
;;          (move-to-window-line 0)) 
;;         ((eq key-times 1)
;;          (beginning-of-line)))))

;;    (defun goto-end ()
;;      (interactive)
;;      (let* ((key-times (viking-last-key-repeats)))
;;        (cond
;;         ((eq key-times 3)
;;          (if mark-active
;;              (goto-char (point-max))
;;            (end-of-buffer))) 
;;         ((eq key-times 2)
;;          (if mark-active () (push-mark))
;;          (move-to-window-line -1)
;;          (end-of-line)) 
;;         ((eq key-times 1)
;;          (end-of-line)))))

;;    (global-set-key (kbd "<home>") 'goto-begin)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "<end>")  'goto-end)

;; When you put this into your .emacs config, then you can do:
;; hit <home> once:  goto beginning of current line
;;          repeat:  goto beginning of current window
;;          repeat:  goto beginning of current buffer

;; (and the same with <end> in the other direction)
